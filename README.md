# Stock and ETF Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing the descriptive statistics of stocks and ETFs over time. By examining trading patterns, we can better understand the influence of algorithmic trading and develop intuition for applying AI in financial markets.

## Features
- Data analysis of stock and ETF trading patterns
- Visualization using Plotly
- Insights into evolving trading trends

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (primary programming language)
- **Plotly** (for data visualization)
- **Pandas** (for data handling and manipulation)
- **NumPy** (for numerical computations)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for interactive data exploration)

## Installation
To run this project, install the required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install plotly pandas numpy jupyter
```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`AS1.ipynb`).
2. Run the cells to load and analyze the data.
3. Visualize stock and ETF trends using interactive Plotly graphs.
